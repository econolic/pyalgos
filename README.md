## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pyalgos.git
cd pyalgos

# Install development dependencies (optional)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from pyalgos.linear.stack import Stack
from pyalgos.trees.segment_tree import SegmentTree
from pyalgos.union_find.disjoint_set_union import DisjointSetUnion

# Stack operations
stack = Stack[int]()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
print(stack.pop())  # 2

# Range queries with SegmentTree
tree = SegmentTree.create_sum_tree([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])
print(tree.range_query(1, 3))  # 15 (sum of elements 3+5+7)

# Union-Find operations
dsu = DisjointSetUnion(5)
dsu.union(0, 1)
dsu.union(2, 3)
print(dsu.connected(0, 1))  # True
print(dsu.num_components())  # 3
```
