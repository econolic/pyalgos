**Product Requirements Document: Python DSA Library**

**1. Introduction & Vision**

This document outlines the requirements for **PyAlgos**, a Python library of fundamental data structures and algorithms. The project's vision is to create a high-quality, well-documented, and rigorously tested educational and practical tool. It is designed to provide clear, modern, and efficient Python implementations that serve as a learning resource for students and a reliable component for developers and researchers.

**2. Target Audience**

- **Students & Educators:** Individuals learning or teaching computer science fundamentals who need clear, canonical implementations to study.
- **Competitive Programmers:** Programmers who need a reliable, easy-to-use set of tools for solving algorithmic challenges.
- **Software Engineers & Researchers:** Professionals who need to quickly prototype or implement solutions requiring non-standard data structures.

**3. Features & Scope**

**3.1. Core Library Modules**

The library will be modularized by data structure/algorithm category. Each implementation must meet the following standards:

- **Code Quality:** Clean, readable, PEP 8 compliant Python 3.10+ code.
- **Type Hinting:** Full type hinting for all function signatures and variables.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive docstrings (Google style) for every class and method, detailing its purpose, parameters, return values, and time/space complexity.
- **Testing:** A robust unit test suite using the pytest framework, aiming for >95% code coverage.
- **Benchmarking:** Performance benchmarks for key operations using the timeit module to validate theoretical complexity.
- **Usage Examples:** A clear script in an examples/ directory demonstrating typical use cases for each module.

The following modules will be included:

|**Category**|**Structure/Algorithm**|**Key Features**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**Linear Structures**|Stack|Array-based implementation; push, pop, peek operations.|
||Queue|Array-based (circular) implementation; enqueue, dequeue, peek.|
||LinkedList|Doubly linked list; append, prepend, delete, find operations.|
|**Heaps**|BinaryHeap|Min-heap implementation; insert, extract\_min, peek.|
|**Trees**|SegmentTree|Supports range queries (sum, min, max) and point updates. Lazy propagation for range updates.|
||Trie|Supports insert, search, and starts\_with (prefix search).|
|**Sets**|DisjointSetUnion|Union-by-size and path-compression optimizations.|
|**Graphs**|Graph|Adjacency list representation for directed and undirected graphs. add\_edge, get\_neighbors.|
||Traversal|bfs and dfs algorithms.|

**3.2. Problem Round: Offline Dynamic Connectivity**

To demonstrate the library's utility, a complex problem will be solved by combining its modules.

- **Problem Statement:** You are given an initially empty graph with N nodes. You will receive a series of M edge updates (additions or removals) and Q queries. Each query asks whether two nodes, u and v, are connected. All updates and queries are provided upfront (i.e., this is an *offline* problem).
- **Goal:** Efficiently answer all connectivity queries. This problem requires combining the SegmentTree and DisjointSetUnion data structures to achieve an efficient solution. The implementation must be a standalone, well-documented script that uses the created library.

**4. Non-Goals**

- **Replacing Standard Libraries:** This library is not intended to replace or outperform Python's highly optimized built-in modules (collections, heapq).
- **Exhaustive Scope:** The library will not implement every known data structure. The focus is on depth, quality, and conceptual clarity for the selected items.
- **Production-Level C/Rust Optimization:** The implementations will be in pure Python. The goal is clarity and correctness, not achieving the performance of a low-level implementation.

**5. Success Metrics**

- **Correctness:** All unit tests for all modules pass without errors.
- **Performance:** Benchmark results align with the theoretical time complexities of the implemented algorithms.
- **Completeness:** All specified modules and features are implemented, documented, and tested.
- **Utility:** The library modules are successfully used to implement a clear and correct solution to the Offline Dynamic Connectivity problem.
